            <p>Welcome to Piano Hero</p>
            <p>In Piano Hero, the player is given a virtual piano, with which, they must follow along with the tabs on the screen to one the popular song choices from the menu!</p>
            <p>These tabs will be listed as keys you must hit on your keyboard, if you <span class='error'>miss</span> a key, it will be counted against you, but if you get at least 70% you <span class="correct">pass!</span></p>
            <p> In this game, case sensitivity DOES matter. Lowercase letters stand for regular notes, where as uppercase represents sharp notes</p>
            <p>This game also comes with a free play option! If you want to use this device to learn piano with your own notes, hit free play. You have the  <button class = "switch-btn-instruction">Switch </button> button on your keyboard to switch to ACTUAL music notes so that you know what each keyboard key represents </p>
            <p>Please note, don't get characters such as the bracket <span class="game-font">]</span> and the letter <span class="game-font">J</span>mixed up, they are different!</p>
            <p>Have fun!</p>
